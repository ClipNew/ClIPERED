                <span>What's the difference between your one-time fee and the monthly costs?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>My pricing plans cover a <strong>one-time setup fee</strong> for architecting and building your custom digital infrastructure. This includes the landing page, automations, and dashboards. The <strong>ongoing monthly costs</strong> (like your Facebook Ads budget or Chatmaxima subscription) are paid directly to those third-party services and are completely under your control.</p>

                <p>The timeline depends on the complexity of the plan you choose. A 'Startup Architect' plan can be deployed in as little as 1-2 weeks, while more comprehensive 'Enterprise' solutions may take 3-4 weeks to fully implement, test, and optimize.</p>

                <span>Do I need to be technical to use the systems you build?</span>

            </summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Not at all. My primary goal is to build intuitive, user-friendly systems. I design dashboards and processes that are easy to manage, and for 'Premium' and 'Enterprise' plans, I provide dedicated training to ensure your team is confident and proficient from day one.</p>

                <p>Clients typically see a significant reduction in manual administrative work, a higher volume of qualified leads, and a more streamlined applicant tracking process. The goal is to free up your team's time to focus on high-value tasks like interviewing and client relations, which directly translates to business growth.</p>
