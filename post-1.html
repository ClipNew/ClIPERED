                <p>In the fast-paced world of recruitment, time is your most valuable asset. Yet, countless hours are lost to repetitive, manual tasks that could easily be automated. By implementing a few key systems, you can reclaim that time and empower your team to focus on what truly matters: building relationships and placing candidates.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Initial Candidate Screening</h2>
                <p>Instead of manually sifting through every resume, use a chatbot on your website or Facebook page to ask initial qualifying questions. This ensures that only candidates who meet your basic criteria make it to your desk.</p>

                <h2>2. Interview Scheduling</h2>
                <p>The back-and-forth of scheduling interviews is a major time sink. Integrate a tool like Calendly or a scheduling feature within your web app to allow qualified candidates to book a time slot that works for them instantly.</p>
